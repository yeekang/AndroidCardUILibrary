dummy library only provide a cardview using layout similar to item2.xml in main app. text value are hardcoded, in TestThis.java in library directory.

code changed in app file to show usage of library:
    - RecyclerViewActivity.java : line 35 to 59.
    - gradle : line 57.


changes need to be made on RVAdapter to allow it work as library.

configure table
delete from card where type ='BULLETIN' OR type='OPPORTUNITYMAP' OR type='TRANSACTION' OR type='QUICKBITES';
